This tutorial demonstrates point-editing techniques including moving and scaling control points and adding knots to surfaces to increase control. In addition, you will use blends to create smooth transitions between surfaces.

## You will learn how to:

1. Rebuild surfaces to add additional control points.
1. Insert knots in a surface to add control points in a specific location.
1. Edit surface control points to define a shape.
1. Scale control points to change the object shape.
1. Use object snaps projected to the construction plane.
1. Orient an object on a surface.
1. Create smooth blends between surfaces.
1. To download the tutorial model
